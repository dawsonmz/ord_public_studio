# Oslo Roller Derby public Sanity Studio

Sanity Studio project for the public website. Hosted on Sanity directly.

To run Sanity Studio locally, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The local instance will be hosted at http://localhost:3333. Note that it is still connected to the production Sanity content lake, so any changes to documents made there will be reflected in production.

To deploy Sanity Studio to production, run:

```bash
sanity deploy
```
